# Predictive-Maintenance-of-Industrial-Equipment-using-Machine-Learning
### Overview
This study emphasizes the creation of machine learning models to predict industrial equipment maintenance needs.  Based on sensor and operational data, the models indicate potential machine failures, enabling companies to schedule maintenance in advance, avoid unplanned downtime, and maximize operational expenditures.
### Problem Statement
Industrial equipment must run well for many years.  Conventional repair maintenance reacts to failures but often leads to expensive downtime.  Preventive maintenance fixes problems prior to their occurrence, though at a high expense due to unnecessary treatments.

Predictive maintenance offers a better alternative by utilizing real-time information and machine learning to forecast equipment failure before they happen.  This method allows for immediate interventions, reduces downtime, and saves money.

It seeks to explore predictive maintenance, the application of supervised machine learning algorithms for classifying and predicting imminent machine failures.  Python libraries and machine learning are the predominant means of making models that business enterprises use for enhancing operational dependability.
### Aims and Objectives
The overall objective of this project is to create machine learning-based predictive maintenance solutions that meet Industry 4.0 standards. Objectives are:
* Anomaly detection is the process of detecting unusual patterns in sensor readings that suggest likely issues.
* Failure Prediction: Based on past data, decide if a piece of equipment will fail in the near future.
* Model Comparison: Compare and compare a number of machine learning algorithms to find the most suitable for predictive maintenance tasks.
### Features
Data preprocessing: It is cleaning, eliminating missing values, and preparing data for modeling.

Feature Engineering: Feature Engineering is creating meaningful input features to enhance model learning and performance.

Modeling: Modeling is applying and compring four machine learning techniques.

Logistic regression

The Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Evaluation: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics are employed to judge models holistically.

Visualization: Utilize confusion matrices, ROC curves, and feature significance plots to gain insight into model output.

### Results and Discussion
#### Results
Results
Logistic Regression reported a high 95.70% accuracy and an AUC of 0.9872 but its low precision for the minority class (0.44) restricted its reliability in predicting failure.  The Decision Tree model reported an accuracy of 96.15% and AUC of 0.9304, indicating a fair trade-off between precision and recall with moderate overfitting. Random Forest was the best, with 97.80% accuracy, AUC of 0.9870, and highest F1-Score of 0.75 for predicting equipment failures.  SVM model had 95.95% accuracy with highest AUC value of 0.9903, showing high class differentiation capabilities.

#### Discussion
Discussion on logistics.  Regression was good in binary classification but might not be able to identify complex non-linear relationships.
Even with strong test performance, Decision Tree reached perfect training accuracy, suggesting a potential for overfitting.
Random Forest produced the best overall performance, trading excellent accuracy with overfit robustness.
SVM performed well, but computationally intensive.

### Classification Report Summary (Weighted Average)
Accuracy: 98%.
Remember: 96â€“98%
F1 score: 96-98%.

The experiment shows that machine learning algorithms, especially ensemble algorithms like Random Forest, work outstandingly well for predictive maintenance tasks.  Potential future enhancements might involve stronger hyperparameter tuning, the addition of more sophisticated techniques like XGBoost, and the integration of real-time sensor readings to facilitate ongoing model updating.
